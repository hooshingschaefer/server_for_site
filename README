This program will allow me to read and write to files from php scripts on my personal website. 
One thing ucsc doesnt provide for personal sites is sql and I wanted it to be able to save state.

To run a test of the program, go ahead and download all the files save for this one.
make the "server" executable and simply run it.

on the same machine, run the simple.php script and you should see the file echoed out.

Once I get linux on my pc, I will run the server there and hopefully my website will be more exciting once I add features that utilize the
server.
